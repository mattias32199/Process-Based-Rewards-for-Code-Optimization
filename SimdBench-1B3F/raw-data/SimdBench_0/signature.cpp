/*
The inputs to this function are: pointers to:
- A non-empty source array of 64-bit integers (src);
- A non-empty destination array of 64-bit integers (dst);
- A non-empty mask array of boolean values (mask);
- Their common length (length).

Your goal is to conditionally copy elements from src to dst where the corresponding mask value is true.
The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

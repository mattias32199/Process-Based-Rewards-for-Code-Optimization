/*
The inputs to this function are: pointers to two non-empty 32-bit signed integer arrays (src & dst),
a scaling factor (scale), and the arrays' common length (length).
Your goal is to perform the following operations on each element of src and store results in dst:
1. Calculate tmp1 as (element * scale) right-shifted by 3 bits;
2. Calculate tmp2 as (element * scale) left-shifted by 3 bits;
3. Compute the final result as: (element * scale + tmp1 * tmp2) divided by 7;
4. Finally store the result in dst.

Our input guarantee that no overflow will occur during the calculations.
The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

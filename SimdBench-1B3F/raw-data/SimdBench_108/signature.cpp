/*
Implement a function that takes an non-negative integer and returns a vector of the first n
integers that are prime numbers and less than n.
for example:
count_up_to_simd(5) => {2,3}
count_up_to_simd(11) => {2,3,5,7}
count_up_to_simd(0) => {}
count_up_to_simd(20) => {2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19}
count_up_to_simd(1) => {}
count_up_to_simd(18) => {2,3,5,7,11,13,17}

The requirement is to implement the function using [simd] intrinsics to achieve parallelism.

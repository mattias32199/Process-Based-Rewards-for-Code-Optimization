/*
The inputs to this function are::
- A pointer to a 32-bit integer source array (src);
- The length of the array (length).

Your goal is to find and return the minimum value among the even-numbered elements in the array..
If the array is empty, return -1.
The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

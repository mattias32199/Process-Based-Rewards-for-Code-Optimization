/*
The inputs to this function are::
- A pointer to a 32-bit integer source array (src);
- A pointer to a 32-bit integer destination array (dst);
- the number of each element to be shifted (shift);
- The length of the array (length).

Your goal:
    First, calculate the arithmetic right shift of each element in the array by the given number of bits;
    Then, calculate the logical right shift of each element in the array by the same number of bits,
    converting each int to uint before shifting, and then casting the result back to int;
    Finally, add the results of the arithmetic and logical shifts together and store them in the destination array.

The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

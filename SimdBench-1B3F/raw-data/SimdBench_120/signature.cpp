/*
Given a non-empty vector of 16-bit integers, return the sum of all of the odd elements that are in even positions.
Examples
solution_simd({5, 8, 7, 1}) ==> 12
solution_simd({3, 3, 3, 3, 3}) ==> 9
solution_simd({30, 13, 24, 321}) ==>0

The requirement is to implement the function using [simd] intrinsics to achieve parallelism.

/*
The Brazilian factorial is defined as:
brazilian_factorial(n) = n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!
where n > 0

For example:
>>> special_factorial_simd(4)
288

The function will receive an integer as input and should return the special
factorial of this integer.

The requirement is to implement the function using [simd] intrinsics to achieve parallelism.

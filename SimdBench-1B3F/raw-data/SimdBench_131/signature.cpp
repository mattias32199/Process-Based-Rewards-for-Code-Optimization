/*
Write a function that takes a vector of numbers as input and returns 
the number of elements in the vector that are greater than 10 and both 
first and last digits of a number are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
For example:
specialFilter_simd({15, -73, 14, -15}) => 1 
specialFilter_simd({33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109}) => 2

The requirement is to implement the function using [simd] intrinsics to achieve parallelism.

/*
The inputs to this function are::
- A pointer to a 8-bit integer source array (src);
- The length of the array (length).

Your goal is to find the index of the maximum value in the array and return it.
If the input array is empty, return 0.
The index should be returned as a size_t value.
The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

/*
The inputs to this function are::
- A pointer to a non-empty uint16_t source array (src);
- A pointer to a non-empty uint16_t destination array (dst);
- A uint32_t mask value (mask);
- The length of the array (length).

Your goal is to blend two arrays based on the following condition:
    If the bitwise AND of the element's index and the mask is non-zero, take the value from src1; 
    otherwise, take the value from src2.
The result should be stored in the destination array (dst).

The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

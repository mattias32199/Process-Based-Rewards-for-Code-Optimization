/*
The inputs to this function are::
- A pointer to a non-empty uint32_t source array (src);
- A pointer to a non-empty uint32_t destination array (dst);
- The length of the array (length).

Your goal is to calculate the population count (the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of an integer) 
for each element in the array.
The result should be stored in the destination array (dst).

The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

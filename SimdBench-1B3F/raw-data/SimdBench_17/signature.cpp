/*
The inputs to this function are::
- A pointer to a non-empty 16-bit unsigned integer source array (src1);
- A pointer to a non-empty 16-bit unsigned integer source array (src2);
- A pointer to a non-empty 16-bit unsigned integer destination array (dst);
- The length of the array (length).

Your goal is to calculate the element-wise addition of two arrays (src1 and src2)
and store the result in the destination array (dst).
The addition should be saturating, meaning that if the result exceeds the maximum value for uint16_t,
it should be clamped to UINT16_MAX.

The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

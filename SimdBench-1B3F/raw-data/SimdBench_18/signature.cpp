/*
The inputs to this function are::
- A pointer to a non-empty 64-bit floating-point (double) source matrix (A);
- A pointer to a non-empty 64-bit floating-point (double) source matrix (B);
- A pointer to a non-empty 64-bit floating-point (double) destination matrix (C);
- The number of rows in matrix A (m);
- The number of columns in matrix A and rows in matrix B (n);
- The number of columns in matrix B (p).

A, B, and C are 2D matrices flattened into 1D arrays.
Your goal is to perform matrix multiplication of A and B for elements in the range [-100, 100]
(i.e., skipping summing elements when A[i] or B[i] outside the range),
and store the result in C.

The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

/*
The inputs to this function are::
- A pointer to a non-empty 64-bit integer source tensor (A);
- A pointer to a non-empty 64-bit integer source tensor (B);
- A pointer to a non-empty 64-bit integer destination tensor (C);
- The dimensions of the tensor (dim1, dim2, dim3).

A, B, and C are 3D tensors stored in non-empty 1D arrays.
Your goal is to perform element-wise addition of two 3D tensors (A and B),
and store the result in C (no overflow).

The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

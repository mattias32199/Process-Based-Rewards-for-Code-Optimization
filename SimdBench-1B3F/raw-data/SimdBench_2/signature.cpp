/*
The inputs to this function are: pointers to two non-empty 64-bit floating-point arrays (src & dst),
the number of rows (rows), the number of columns (cols), and a stride value (stride).
Each array is a 1D representation of a 2D matrix with rows * cols elements.
Your goal is to perform the following operations:
For each row r from 0 to rows-1:
Load the element at position (r * cols + stride) from src array, 
Store it in position r of dst array
The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

/*
The inputs to this function are::
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit floating-point source array (src1);
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit floating-point source array (src2);
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit floating-point destination array (dst);
- The length of the arrays (length).

Your goal is to calculate the result of the element-wise addition of src1 and src2,
and then round the result to the nearest integer.
Finally, the result should be stored in the dst array.

The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

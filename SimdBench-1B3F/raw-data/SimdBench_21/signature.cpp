/*
The inputs to this function are::
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit floating-point source array (src1);
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit floating-point source array (src2);
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit floating-point destination array (dst);
- The length of the arrays (length).

Your goal is to calculate the result of the element-wise multiplication of src1 and src2
for elements that meet the following conditions:
    1: the absolute value of the difference is within 50;
    2: index is is a multiple of 2.
and then round the result up toward positive infinity.
For elements that do not meet the above conditions, the results should be -1.
Finally, the result should be stored in the dst array.

The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

/*
The inputs to this function are::
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit floating-point matrix (mat) that is flattened into a 1D array;
- The number of rows in the matrix (m);
- The number of columns in the matrix (n).

Your goal is to normalize each row of the matrix mat by dividing each element in the row by the L^2 norm of that row.
The L^2 norm is calculated as the square root of the sum of squares of the elements in the row.

The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

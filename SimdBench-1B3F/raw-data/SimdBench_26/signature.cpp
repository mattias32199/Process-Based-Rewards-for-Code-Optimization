/*
The inputs to this function are::
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit floating-point tensor (tensor1);
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit floating-point tensor (tensor2);
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit floating-point destination tensor (dst);
- The first dimension of the tensor (dim1);
- The second dimension of the tensor (dim2);
- The third dimension of the tensor (dim3).

tensor1, tensor2, and dst are 3D tensors in the shape (dim1, dim2, dim3) flattened into 1D arrays.
Your goal is to perform element-wise subtraction of tensor1 and tensor2,
and then round the result towards zero.
The result should be stored in the dst tensor.

The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

/*
The inputs to this function are::
- A pointer to a non-empty 64-bit floating-point matrix (mat);
- The number of rows in the matrix (m);
- The number of columns in the matrix (n).

Your goal is to calculate and return the average of elements in the matrix mat.
The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

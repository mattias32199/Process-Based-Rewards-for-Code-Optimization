/*
This function takes a 32-bit non-empty floating-point source array, a 32-bit non-empty integer array of indices, and a 32-bit floating-point
destination array, all of the same length. 

The function performs two operations:
- First, it copies values from the source array to the destination array using the indices 
as lookups (gather operation);
- Then it copies values from the source array to the destination 
array using the indices as write locations (scatter operation).

The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

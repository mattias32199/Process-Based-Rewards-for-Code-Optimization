/*
The inputs to this function are::
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit integer matrix (matrix);
- A pointer to a boolean array (directions) indicating the sort direction for each row;
- The number of rows in the matrix (rows);
- The number of columns in the matrix (cols).

Your goal is to check if each row in the matrix is sorted according to the specified direction.
The value of the boolean array (directions) indicates whether the row should be sorted in ascending (true) or descending (false) order.

The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

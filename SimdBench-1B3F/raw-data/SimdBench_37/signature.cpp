/*
The inputs to this function are::
- A pointer to a 32-bit integer matrix (matrix);
- The size of each block (block_size);
- The number of rows in the matrix (rows);
- The number of columns in the matrix (cols).

Your goal is to check if all blocks of the matrix are equal to the first block.
Return true if the given matrix can be perfectly divided into identical blocks of shape (block_size, block_size); 
otherwise, return false.
If block_size is illegal, return false.
The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

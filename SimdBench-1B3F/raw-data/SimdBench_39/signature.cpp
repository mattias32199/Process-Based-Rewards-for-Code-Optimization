/*
The inputs to this function are::
- A pointer to a non-empty 64-bit floating-point matrix (matrix);
- A pointer to a non-empty 64-bit floating-point vector (thresholds);
- The number of rows in the matrix (rows);
- The number of columns in the matrix (cols).
- A pointer to a boolean result array (result).

The input matrix is flattened into a 1D array.
Your goal is to check if the Euclidean norm of each row in the matrix exceeds the corresponding threshold in the vector.
The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

/*
The inputs to this function are::
- A pointer to a 16-bit non-empty integer array (arr);
- The 64-bit starting index (start);
- The 64-bit ending index (end).

Your goal is to reverse the elements in the array between the start and end indices (inclusive), the remaining elements should be unchanged.
The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

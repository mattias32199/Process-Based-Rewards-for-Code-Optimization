/*
The inputs to this function are::
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit unsigned integer tensor (A);
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit unsigned integer tensor (B);
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit unsigned integer tensor (C);
- The common length of A, B, and C.

Your goal is to perform element-wise bitwise OR operation between tensors A and B,
and then store the result in tensor C.

The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

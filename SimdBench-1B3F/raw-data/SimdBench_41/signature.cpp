/* 
The inputs to this function are::
- Pointers to two non-empty 8-bit integer vector (A, B);
- The common length of A and B

Your goal is to return the difference between the sum of squares and the sum of products.
The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

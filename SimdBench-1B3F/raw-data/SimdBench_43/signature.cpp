/*
The inputs to this function are::
- A pointer to a non-empty 8-bit integer tensor (A);
- A pointer to a non-empty 8-bit integer tensor (B);
- A pointer to a non-empty 8-bit integer tensor (C);
- The common length of A, B, and C.

Your goal is to perform element-wise three-valued logic operation on tensors A and B,
if A[i][j][k] and B[i][j][k] are both positive, C[i][j][k] should be 1;
if A[i][j][k] and B[i][j][k] are both negative, C[i][j][k] should be -1;
in other cases, C[i][j][k] should be 0.

The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

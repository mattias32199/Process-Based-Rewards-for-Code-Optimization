/*
The inputs to this function are::
- A pointer to a non-empty 16-bit unsigned integer tensor (A);
- A pointer to a non-empty 16-bit unsigned integer tensor (B);
- A pointer to a non-empty 16-bit unsigned integer tensor (C);
- The common length of A, B, and C.

Your goal is to perform the following operation to A and B,
and then store the result in tensor C:
for the element **exactly** at the midpoint: keep the value in A;
for elements before the midpoint: values are element-wise bitwise XOR operation between A and B;
for elements before the midpoint: values are element-wise bitwise AND operation between A and B.

The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

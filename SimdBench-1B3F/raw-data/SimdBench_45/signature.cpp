/*
The inputs to this function are::
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit floating-point tensor (A);
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit floating-point tensor (B);
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit floating-point tensor (C);
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit floating-point tensor (D);
- A pointer to a boolean condition tensor (cond1);
- A pointer to a boolean condition tensor (cond2);
- The first dimension of the tensor (dim1);
- The second dimension of the tensor (dim2);
- The third dimension of the tensor (dim3).

A, B, C, and D are 3D tensors that are flattened into 1D arrays.
Your goal is to perform element-wise selection based on the conditions in cond1 and cond2.
If cond1[i][j][k] is true and cond2[i][j][k] is true, out[i][j][k] should be A[i][j][k];
if cond1[i][j][k] is true and cond2[i][j][k] is false, out[i][j][k] should be B[i][j][k];
if cond1[i][j][k] is false and cond2[i][j][k] is true, out[i][j][k] should be C[i][j][k];
if cond1[i][j][k] is false and cond2[i][j][k] is false, out[i][j][k] should be D[i][j][k].
The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

/*
The inputs to this function are::
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit integer matrix (A);
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit integer destination matrix (B);
- The number of rows in the matrix (rows);
- The number of columns in the matrix (cols).

A and B are 2D matrices flattened into 1D arrays.
Your goal is to apply the condition to the matrix A. If the condition is true,
the corresponding element in C should be the absolute value of A.
If the condition is false, the corresponding element in C should be the same as in A.
The condition is whether the current element is divisible by 3.

The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

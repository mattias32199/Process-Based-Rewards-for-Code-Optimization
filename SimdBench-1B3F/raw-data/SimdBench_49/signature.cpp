/*
The inputs to this function are::
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit floating-point tensor (A);
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit floating-point tensor (B);
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit floating-point tensor (out);
- A floating-point epsilon value (epsilon);
- The common length of the tensors.

Your goal is to perform element-wise comparison between tensors A and B.
If A[i] - B[i] > abs(epsilon), out[i] should be 1;
if A[i] - B[i] < -abs(epsilon), out[i] should be -1;
if abs(A[i] - B[i]) <= abs(epsilon), out[i] should be 0.

The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

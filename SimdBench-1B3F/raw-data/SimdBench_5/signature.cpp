/*
The inputs to this function are::
- A pointer to a 3D tensor stored in an non-empty 1D array (tensor);
- The dimensions of the tensor (dim1, dim2, dim3);
- The index of the slice to extract (slice_idx).

Your goal is to extract a 2D slice from the 3D tensor (represented as a flattened 1D array in memory) 
along the third dimension (dim3) at the given index (slice_idx).
The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

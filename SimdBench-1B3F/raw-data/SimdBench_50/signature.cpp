/*
Input to this function are:
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit floating-point (float) source array (A);
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit integer (int32_t) destination array (B);
- The common length of the arrays (size).

Your goal is to convert the float values in A to int32_t values in B.
The conversion should be done in a way that if the float value is greater than INT32_MAX,
it should be set to INT32_MAX, and if its value is less than INT32_MIN, it should be set to INT32_MIN, 
otherwise, it should be converted to int32_t directly.

The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

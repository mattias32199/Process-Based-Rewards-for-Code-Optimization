/*
Input to this function are:
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit floating-point (float) source array (A);
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit floating-point (float) source array (B);
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit integer (int32_t) destination array (C);
- The common length of the arrays (size).

Your goal is to perform element-wise division of A by B,
and round the result to the nearest integer in the range that can be represented by a 32-bit integer.
The result should be stored in C.

The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

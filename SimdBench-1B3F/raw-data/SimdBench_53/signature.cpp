/*
Input to this function are:
- A pointer to a non-empty 64-bit floating-point (double) source array (A);
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit floating-point (float) destination array (B);
- The common length of the arrays (size).

Your goal is to convert the double values in A to float values in B.
The conversion should be done in a way that if the double value is greater than FLT_MAX,
it should be set to FLT_MAX, and if it is less than -FLT_MAX, it should be set to -FLT_MAX, else
it should be converted to float directly.

The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

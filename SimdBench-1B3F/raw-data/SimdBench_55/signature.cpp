/*
Input to this function are:
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit floating-point (float) source array (A);
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit integer (int32_t) control array (control);
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit floating-point (float) destination array (B);
- The common length of the arrays (size);
- A float min_val;
- A float max_val.

Your goal is to min-max normalize the values in array A based on the control array and the given min_val and max_val.

The min-max normalization should be done in a way that if the control value is greater than 0,
the value in A should be normalized to the range [0, 1] using min_val and max_val.

The normalization formula is:
val = (A[i] - min_val) / (max_val - min_val);
If the result is less than 0, it should be set to 0.0f.
If the result is greater than 1, it should be set to 1.0f.
The result should be stored in B[i].

If the control value is less than or equal to 0, the value in A should be copied directly to B.
The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

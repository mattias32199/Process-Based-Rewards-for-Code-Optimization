/*
Input to this function are:
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit unsigned integer (uint32_t) source array (A);
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit floating-point (float) destination array (B);
- The common length of the arrays (size).

Your goal is:
    First, convert the high 16 bits of the uint32_t value in A to float;
    Then, take the square root of the float value;
    Finally, store the result in B.

The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

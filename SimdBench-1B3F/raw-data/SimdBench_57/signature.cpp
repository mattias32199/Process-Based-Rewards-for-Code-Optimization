/*
Input to this function are:
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit unsigned integer (uint32_t) source array (A);
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit floating-point (float) destination array (B);
- The common length of the arrays (size).

Your goal is to:
1. Interpret the bit pattern of each uint32_t value in A as an IEEE 754 floating-point representation
2. Store the resulting float value in B without any numerical conversion
3. This is effectively a type-punning operation that reinterprets the bits directly

The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

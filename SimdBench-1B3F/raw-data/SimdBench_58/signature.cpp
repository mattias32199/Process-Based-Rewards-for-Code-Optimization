/*
Input to this function are:
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit integer (int32_t) source array (A);
- A pointer to a non-empty boolean condition array (cond);
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit floating-point (float) destination array (diff);
- The common length of the arrays (size).

Your goal is to:
1. Compute the difference between consecutive elements (A[i] - A[i-1]) when cond[i] is true
2. Convert the difference to float and store in diff[i]
3. Set diff[i] to 0.0f when cond[i] is false
4. The first element (diff[0]) is always set to 0.0f as there's no previous element

The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

/*
Input to this function are:
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit unsigned integer (uint32_t) source array (src);
- A pointer to a non-empty 64-bit unsigned integer (uint64_t) destination array (dst);
- The common length of the arrays (length).

Your goal is to:
1. Convert each element in src to a 64-bit unsigned integer;
2. Set all the high 32 bits of each value to 1 and store the results in dst.

The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

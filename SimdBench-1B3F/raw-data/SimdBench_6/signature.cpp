/* The inputs to this function are::
- A pointer to a non-empty 16-bit integer source array (src);
- A pointer to a non-empty 16-bit integer destination array (dst);
- The number of rows (rows);
- The number of columns (cols);
- The block size (block_size).

The matrix src and dst are represented as 1D arrays in memory.
Your goal is to transpose the matrix in a blocked manner.
The result should be stored in the destination array.

The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

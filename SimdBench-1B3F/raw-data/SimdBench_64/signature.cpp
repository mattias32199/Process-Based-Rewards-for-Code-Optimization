/*
For a given vector of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
around the mean of this dataset.
Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
MAD = average | x - x_mean |
>>> mean_absolute_deviation_simd({1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0})
1.0

The requirement is to implement the function using [simd] intrinsics to achieve parallelism.

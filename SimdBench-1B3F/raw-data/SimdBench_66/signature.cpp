/*
For a given vector of integers, return a vector consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a vector.
Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.
>>> sum_product_simd({})
(0, 1)
>>> sum_product_simd({1, 2, 3, 4})
(10, 24)

The requirement is to implement the function using [simd] intrinsics to achieve parallelism.

/* The inputs to this function are::
- A pointer to a non-empty 32-bit float array (array), representing a 3D array of dimensions dim*dim*dim, flattened into a 1D array;
- The size of each dimension (dim).

Your goal is to calculate the sum of the diagonal elements (i.e., the ones where the three indices are equal) in a 3D array.
The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics to achieve parallelism.

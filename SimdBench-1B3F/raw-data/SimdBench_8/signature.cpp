/*
The inputs to this function are::
- A pointer to a non-empty 64-bit floating-point (double) source array (src);
- A pointer to a non-empty 64-bit floating-point (double) destination array (dst);
- The number of rows (rows);
- The number of columns (cols);
- A threshold value (threshold);
- A scale factor (scale).

Your goal is to apply a conditional scaling operation on the source array.
If the value is greater than the threshold, scale it by the scale factor; otherwise, keep it unchanged.
The result should be stored in the destination array.

The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.

/*
The inputs to this function are::
- A pointer to a non-empty 64-bit floating-point (double) source matrix stored in an 1D array (src);
- A pointer to a non-empty 64-bit floating-point (double) destination matrix stored in an 1D array (dst);
- The number of rows (rows);
- The number of columns (cols);
- A pointer to an array of indices (indices).

The matrix src and dst are matrix in shape (rows, cols) represented as 1D arrays in memory, and `indices` is a 1D array.
Your goal is to reorder the rows of the source matrix based on the given indices.
The result should be stored in the destination matrix.
The requirement is to implement the function with [simd] intrinsics for parallelism.
